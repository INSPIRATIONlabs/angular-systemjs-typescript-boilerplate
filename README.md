# angular-systemjs-typescript-boilerplate
A angular 1.x Boilerplate with full typescript integration

The typescript conversion of the controller and module components should happen in the IDE. We are currently using atom-typescript to fullfil this dependency.

The tpl.html - templates are automatically converted to ts - files to be able to include them into the typescript sourcecode.
